  "Title": "Live and Think - Creature AI Enhancements",
  "Description": "A mod to add various extra capabilities to creature AI. Each feature can be toggled on/off in the Live and Think options category.\n\nCurrent modules:\nDisarm:\n - When a sufficiently intelligent and mobile creature (enemy or companion) has an item removed via disarming or pulsed field magnets, they will attempt to grab and re-equip that item.\n - If they can't re-equip the same item, they will search for a new one, in their inventory or in the surrounding area.\n\nEquip:\n - Enemies can go to and equip items. This isn't used outside of the Disarm module yet, but will eventually be used for opportunistic item equipping. Creatures might use an area's loot against you!\n\nSmartUse:\n- Enemies with Quills will not use their Quills ability while adjacent to a vulnerable bystander or ally.\n- Enemies in combat will no longer prioritise using non-healing tonics over anything and everything else.\n- Enemies use grenades less indiscriminately, taking into account factors like blast radius and whether any bystanders within that radius are vulnerable to that type of grenade.\n- Enemies use missile weapons, particularly those loaded with explosive ammo, less indiscriminately, taking into account factors like danger radius and whether any bystanders within that radius are vulnerable to that type of ammo.\n\nLogic:\n- Enemies will attack creatures they are hostile to which block the way to their current target.\n\nPlease report any issues in the #modding channel in the Caves of Qud discord (ping Noelle Lavenza), or on the Github issue tracker. Suggestions for additional features or configuration options are welcome as well!\n\nGithub repository: https://github.com/noelle-lavenza/LiveAndThink\n\nLike my work?
