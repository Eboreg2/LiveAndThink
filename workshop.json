  "Title": "Live and Think",
  "Description": "A mod to add various extra capabilities to creature AI.\n\nCurrent modules:\nDisarm:\n - When a sufficiently intelligent and mobile creature (enemy or companion) has an item removed via disarming or pulsed field magnets, they will attempt to grab and re-equip that item.\n - If they can't re-equip the same item, they will search for a new one, in their inventory or in the surrounding area.\n\nEquip:\n - Enemies can go to and equip items. This isn't used outside of the Disarm module yet, but will eventually be used for opportunistic item equipping. Creatures might use an area's loot against you!\n\nPlease report any issues in the #modding channel in the Caves of Qud discord (ping Noelle Lavenza), or on the Github issue tracker. Suggestions for additional features or configuration options are welcome as well!\n\nGithub repository: https://github.com/jade-lavenza/LiveAndThink",
